# biological_cat_age
These programs convert from the age we say a cat is, to its "actual" age.

I noticed that there were various different ways of determining the "actual" age of a cat on the internet. So, I took a bunch of these ways and performed statistical analysis on them. Thus, the equation used in all these programs is the one that resulted from that analysis.
